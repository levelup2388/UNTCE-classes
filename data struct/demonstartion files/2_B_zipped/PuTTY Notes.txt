// using PuTTY ftp.  (PSFTP)

open cse06.cse.unt.edu

// EUID & password at prompt

// I first create a project home directory:
mkdir ./counter
cd ./counter


// If I'm replacing the files, I just delete them. (Yes, PSFTP will also overwrite.)

cd ./counter
rm *

// set your local directory

cd ./counter

/*
	Here is my makefile:  (The tabs are critical... four spaces do not a tab make!

CFLAGS = -O
CC = g++

cntDemo: driver.o counter.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o cntDemo driver.o counter.o

driver.o: driver.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c driver.cpp

counter.o: counter.cpp
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c counter.cpp

clean:
	rm -f core *.o


*/

This says to use the g++ compiler.  The output file (exe) is cntDemo; that depends on
driver.o and counter.o

driver.o is compiled from driver.cpp

counter.o is compiled from counter.cpp and that #include counter.h

Be sure your editor is using the tab character, not converting to spaces.
