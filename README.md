"# UNTCE-classes" 
This is a summation of files of the project I did from various classes at UNT for my Computer Engineering Degree
Not totaly encapsulating of what I did, but for the most part. I mostly use this to grab some of the previous
functions that I made easily, and made it public so that I didnt need to worry about signing in on terminal or something
for ease of use.
